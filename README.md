### Introduction

This is a react app that is used on the website dahling.no

### How to install and run locally

Make sure that you are running node v6 or higher, and npm v3 or higher. Some configuration is required in order for the application to run properly. We have two config files and a database that must set up. These are ignored by git, in order to support different configuration on different pages. We have included examples of everything, so it should not be too hard to configure. Start off by cloning the git directory with `git clone`, replace <username> with your own username:

1. `git clone https://github.com/corneliusgdahling/dahling.no.git`
2. Navigate to `/dahling.no/src`.
3. Run the following commands in source.
```
    npm install
    npm start
```
